## DAY 04

## File system tree

01. Everything is a file

02.  / (Root Directory)
= The directory structure on all Linux systems starts with /. This / is the starting point of the file system.

03. /bin – Basic commands for everyone
= There are commands that all users can run, such as cat, cp, date, echo, grep, etc. These are called binaries or executables.

04. /boot – Boot files
= This contains the files necessary to start the computer.

05. /dev – Device files
= Here, hardware devices are in file form.

06. /etc – Configuration files
= All the system configuration files are located here.

07. /home – User home directories
= Each user has a separate folder in the format /home/username.

08. /lib – Shared libraries
= The libraries needed to run the program are located here.

09. /media & /mnt – Mount points
= /media → Removable drives (USB, CD-ROM) are auto-mounted
= /mnt → For admin to mount manually

10. /proc – Virtual filesystem for kernel info
= This contains real-time info about the system, CPU, and memory. These actually come from RAM, not the hard disk.

11. /root – Root user’s home
= The superuser's personal directory.

12. /sbin – System binaries
= There are tools for system configuration, most of which can be run by the root user.

13. /srv – Service data
= Can store data from web servers, FTP, etc.

14. /sys – sysfs (device info)
= Linux kernel 2.6, hardware info, hotplug support.

15. /tmp – Temporary files
= Program or user temp files are stored here. They may be deleted after a reboot.

16. /usr – Unix System Resources
= Contains shareable, read-only data (such as program documentation, commands, libraries).

17. /var – Variable data
= Data that changes over time, such as log files /var/log, queue files /var/spool, cache /var/cache.




## practice : file system tree

01. Does the file /bin/cat exist ? What about /bin/dd and /bin/echo. What is the type of these files ?
= ls /bin/cat ; file /bin/cat
= ls /bin/dd ; file /bin/dd
= ls /bin/echo ; file /bin/echo

02. What is the size of the Linux kernel file(s) (vmlinu*) in /boot ?
= ls -lh /boot/vm*
