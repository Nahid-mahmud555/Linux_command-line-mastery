Title : Working With Directories
This chapter is small overview of the most common commands to work with directories : pwd, cd, ls,mkdir, rmdir. These commands are available on any Linux (or Unix) system.


01. pwd = Print Working Directory
= If you use it, the computer tells you where you are now located in the file system.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwd
/home/kali


02. cd = Change Directory
= Using it you can move from one folder (directory) to another inside the computer
                                                                                                                                                                   
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cd /etc    
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/etc]
└─$ pwd
/etc

03. cd ~ 
= Takes you to the home directory

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/etc]
└─$ cd /etc
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/etc]
└─$ pwd
/etc
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/etc]
└─$ cd ~   
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwd
/home/kali


04. cd ..
= Using the command allows you to move one step up to the directory (folder)

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwd
/home/kali
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cd ..
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/home]
└─$ pwd
/home


05. cd -
= If used, you can go back to your previous directory (previous place)

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/home]
└─$ pwd
/home
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/home]
└─$ cd - 
~
                                                                                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwd
/home/kali


## Absolute and Relative paths

06. /home/kali 
= When the path or address begins with /, it starts with the root directory (the place at the top of the file system). [ Absolute Path ]

07. cd etc
= If you type path with no / without, it starts at your current directory.[ Relative Paths ]

08. Path Completion with Tab Key 
= Pressing the Tab key auto-completes the rest of the terminal — if he understands what you want to write
= Pressing Double Tab shows suggestions if multiple matches are found.


09. ls = List
= With the ls command you can see the list of files and folders inside a directory.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Nahid_Mahmud  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos

10. ls -a = List All
= Entering the -a option in the ls command shows all files, even hidden files

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ls -a
.             Documents   .java   .mozilla      Pictures      Videos  
..            .bashrc.original  .config   Downloads  .gnupg         .kde    Music     .wget-hsts   .zprofile
.cache         Desktop        .ICEauthority  .local  Nahid_Mahmud  Public    Templates      .Xauthority  

                                                                                                               
11. ls -l
= ls -l (note that lowercase L, not number 1) gives you a long list of files and folders in the directory — showing more information, not just names.

ls -l
drwxrwxr-x 2 kali kali  40 Jul 30 21:50 Nahid_Mahmud
drwxr-xr-x 2 kali kali  40 Jul 30 13:50 Pictures

12. ls -lh
= -l shows → detailed (long) list -h shows → human-readable file size (eg: 10K, 2M, 1.5G)

13. mkdir = Make Directory
= You can create new folders with it.
                                                                                                                                                                 
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ mkdir New_Folder  
                                                                                                                                                              
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ls   
 Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Nahid_Mahmud  New_Folder  Pictures  Public   Templates  Videos
 
 
 14. mkdir -p
 = mkdir -p reports/2025/Aug
 =This will create these folders together (if they do not have one)
 reports/
└── 2025/
    └── Aug
    
 15. rmdir = Remove The Directory
 = It only deletes empty directories
 
 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ls
 Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Nahid_Mahmud  New_Folder  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
 
 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ rmdir New_Folder 
                                                                                                                                                                    
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ls
 Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Nahid_Mahmud  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos [ Remove New_Folder ]
 
 
 16. rmdir -p
 = rmdir -p = deletes one or more empty directories with Parent together
 = If the following folders are all empty, they will all be deleted at once. But nothing will be deleted if there is no blank.
 
 mkdir -p reports/2025/Aug



##  practice : working with directories

1. Display your current directory.
= pwd

2. Change to the /etc directory.
= cd /etc

3. Now change to your home directory using only three key presses.
= cd (and the enter key)

4. Change to the /boot/grub directory using only eleven key presses
= cd /bo[TAB]/gr[TAB]

5. Go to the parent directory of the current directory
= cd ..

6. Go to the root directory.
= cd /

7. List the contents of the root directory.
= ls

8. List a long listing of the root directory
= ls -l

9. Stay where you are, and list the contents of /etc
= ls /etc

10. Stay where you are, and list the contents of /bin and /sbin
= ls /bin /sbin

11. Stay where you are, and list the contents of ~
= ls ~

12. List all the files (including hidden files) in your home directory.
 = ls -al ~
 
 13. List the files in /boot in a human readable format.
 = ls -lh /boot
 
 14. Create a directory testdir in your home directory.
 = cd ~/testdir
 
 15. Change to the /etc directory, stay here and create a directory newdir in your home directory
 = cd /etc , mkdir ~/newdir
 
 16.  Create in one command the directories ~/dir1/dir2/dir3 (dir3 is a subdirectory from dir2, and dir2 is a subdirectory from dir1 ).
= mkdir p ~/dir1/dir2/dir3

17.  Remove the directory testdir.
= rmdir testdir

## If time permits use and understand pushd and popd. Use the man page of bash to find information about pushd, popd and dirs.
= man bash
