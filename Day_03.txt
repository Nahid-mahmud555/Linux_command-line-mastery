## Day_03

Topic Name : Working with filecontents

01. head command:
= By default, the first 10 lines of the head file are displayed.
= If you want to see a specific number of lines [ head -4 ] 9 The first 4 lines will be displayed.)
= If you want to see a specific number of bytes [ head -c 4 ] ( The first 4 bytes will be displayed. )

02. tail command:
= Just the opposite of head, it shows the last 10 lines.
= tail -3 [ Will show the last 3 lines of the file ]

03. cat comand : concatenate
= It is used to view, attach, and create files.
= cat [file name] ( With this command you can view the entire file on the screen. )
= Showing multiple files side by side [ cat file1 file2 file3 ]
= Creating a new file [ cat > new.txt ]
= To indicate the end of writing with << [ cat > nahid.txt <<stop ]
= Copying a file to another file [ cat nahid.txt > first.txt ]

04. tac coammand :
= The opposite of cat. Displays the lines of the file in reverse.

05. more and less commands:
= more shows one page at a time. Pressing space will take you to the next page, pressing q will close.
= less is the improved version — more convenient for moving up and down.

06. strings command : 
= Finds readable ASCII text in a binary file


### practice : file contents 

01. Display the first 12 lines of /etc/services
= head -12 /etc/services

02. Display the last line of /etc/passwd.
= tail -1 /etc/passwd

03. Use cat to create a file named count.txt that looks like this:
One
Two
Three
Four
Five
